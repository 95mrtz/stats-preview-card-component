## My process

I start by observing the challenge and building from the outside in, creating the HTML structure and the sections that the project will have to carry out.

I tried to use more accessible semantics in HTML by using main, section, article and aside and avoid falling into separating everything into divs.

Although I started making the adaptable responsive model for a mobile view, I was discovering and learning how this works with the CSS that is intended to be created for the desktop version, so I managed to learn many new things.

The design was a bit problematic in relation to the img but I was able to understand how to resize it.

I hope you liked my work, I learned and understood many things in this challenge!

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
